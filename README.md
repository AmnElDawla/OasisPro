## How to install it into your personal computer

To begin, we have to make sure that you have installed git in your virtual machine. To check this, go to gnome-terminal and type git --version as seen in the picture below. Make sure that you receive a version for your git and not an error.

After this, we will need to create a local repository that store a clone of the project somewhere in your computer. In my workspace, I created mine in my desktop as seen in the image below (circled in blue).
