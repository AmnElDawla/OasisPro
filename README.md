## How to work on this project in your personal computer

To begin, we have to make sure that you have installed git in your virtual machine. To check this, go to gnome-terminal and type git --version as seen in the picture below. Make sure that you receive a version for your git and not an error.

After this, we will need to create a local repository that store a clone of the project somewhere in your computer. In my workspace, I created mine in my desktop as seen in the image below (circled in blue).

After this go to the directory of that folder as seen in the image below.
